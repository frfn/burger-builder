Deploying React Apps!
Super Easy. 

Steps
    1. Check and Adjust Basepath --> <BrowserRouter basename='my-app' />
        - change basename if you have to

    2. Build and Optimize Project --> npm run build (comes in create-react-app project)
        - npm run build

    3. Server must ALWAYS serve index.html (also for 404 cases) to ensure that Routing works correctly
        - index.html (so that this route will be hit first no matter what, fail safe)
            ie. i visit /users right away... not known by server, since it is defined in application!
        - 404 cases

    4. Upload build artifacts to (static) server
        - once running the 2nd step, upload them to a static server
            /build folder in create-react-app

HANDS ON
    Deploying

    1. added a basename 'flexers-app'
    2. Always return index.html file, static host lets us configure this, set up a catch all route and return index.html
    3. npm run build
    4. /build is now is project folder
    5. checked out all the files in /build folder (nothing really interesting but index.html)
    6. Uploading
        1. MUST USE 'sudo npm install -g firebase-tools' -- gave me error saying I don't have permission
        2. firebase login
            - went to google online and made me sign in to current Firebase account (gmail account)
        3. firebase init
            - Hosting is the only feature selected
            - Choose a Project
                1. use an existing project
                2. public directory? 'build' is the answer
                3. configure as a SPA? 'y' is the answer
                4. automatic builds and deploys with Github? No
                5. rewrite build/index.html and overwrite? No
                6. .firebaserc and firebase.json are created, this is firebase code, look into it more if you want
        4. firebase deploy
            - visit application!

Cool it's deployed!
    - Got someone to test!
